This message indicates that Python was successfully installed

Once you have downloaded VS Code, open the applciation and click “File” from the top left navigation bar, then click “Open Folder”, select the folder that bundles corresponding spreadsheets and python code. 

From the left file explorer menu, navigate to the python file you are interested in running
NOTE: attempting to view a spreadsheet in VS Code gives you a warning message that says: “The file is not displayed in the text editor because it is either binary or uses an unsupported text encoding”. This is NORMAL. VS Code just doesn’t support spreadsheet viewing in their editor.

On the upper right corner, locate the “Run python file” icon (the icon looks like a triangular play button).
